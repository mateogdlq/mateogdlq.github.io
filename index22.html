<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;text-align: center;text-shadow: 3px 2px white;">Artist Statement</h1>

<p style="background-color: Lightblue ;text-align: center;">I was born in the city of San Francisco. Though I was raised in Sacramento, my parents were still working there and brought me along on the weekends, I always felt like it was the city for me. My father was a photographer growing up and I was not always that interested in it but growing up you start to appreciate more things. I saw the beauty in his art and it showed me a liking in art. Now, I have been taking photos for 3 years and I am more than happy with my progress.</p>

<p> Now that I am taking this class, I knew I was going to create a lot of art and much different art than I am used to. But I really wanted to make the art my own still and show simplicity, which is my style, in my work. From the projects we have done, I am glad I have found that in each one. It was fun learning new programs and learning more in the ones I already use on a dialy basis. </p>
